  Being real web components, Apotomo widgets can be nested. This allows building more *complex widget trees* where widgets are put into containers.
  
  We need a new feature: Tweets should be markable as "loved" if we like them. 



:textile
  Clicking on the heart icon flags the respective @Tweet@ row as _loved_ and redraws the list item.  Let's make the @TwitterWidget@ a container where each loveable tweet item is a separate child widget.
  

  h2. Creating a new widget

  The generator strikes back - we call it @TweetWidget@ as it displays one item, only.

:coderay
  #!bash
  script/generate widget tweet_widget display --haml
      exists  app/cells/
      create  app/cells/tweet_widget
      exists  test/widgets
      create  app/cells/tweet_widget.rb
      create  app/cells/tweet_widget/display.html.haml
      create  test/widgets/tweet_widget_test.rb
  

:textile
  The new class is pretty straight-forward.
  
= code "app/cells/tweet_widget.rb", :tag => "v8"

:textile
  Somebody has to pass in the @Tweet@ instance we have to display - that's usually the container's job.
  
  Containing some JavaScript capable of improvement, the view is still simple. I never said I'm good at JavaScript.
  
= code "app/cells/tweet_widget/display.html.haml", :tag => "v8", :language => :haml

:textile
  Basically, if the heart is clicked, an AJAX request is issued (line 10-11) to the url provided by @#url_for_event@ (line 1). Also, we append the id of the loved Tweet object. I never said I'm good at JavaScript.
  
  h2. Embedding widgets into containers
  
  A _container_ widget is no special thing, it's just adding children to itself and rendering 'em. The old @TwitterWidget@ will be the container.
  
= code "app/cells/twitter_widget.rb", :tag => "v9", :lines => 8..14

:textile
  So far, only @#display_form@ changed. For each tweet it appends a new @TweetWidget@ instance passing in the @:tweet@ as parameter (line 10).
  
  It is important to understand that you can use the composing methods like @<<@ or @remove!@ not in controllers @has_widget@ blocks only, but in widgets, too.
  
  
  h2. Rendering children
  
  When calling @render@ without the @:render_children => false@ "option":http://rdoc.info/github/apotonick/apotomo/master/Apotomo/Widget:render, children will be rendered automatically.
  
= code "app/cells/twitter_widget/display_form.html.haml", :tag => "v9", :language => :haml, :lines => 1..5

:textile
  Nothing really changed here as well - except that we simply access the @rendered_children@ hash which contains the rendered child views already (line 2). Pretty handy.
  
= img "with-hearts.png"

:textile
  This looks good. If we click a heart icon... an AJAX request is triggered but brings us back an exception.
  
  @Source "tweet-26" non-existent.@
  
  Well, we are in a stateless setup, so naturally in the triggered state the container widget forgets all the children we added earlier. The problem: when we trigger an event from a tweet widget (by clicking the heart), Apotomo tries to find this widget instance to start bubbling the event. But it's already gone as it didn't survive the request.
  
  Lucky us we already #{page_link "read about that", :stateless}.
  
  h2. Statefulness in a stateless world
  
  The @has_widgets@ block in widgets is our substitution for the lack of statefulness here (hey, you chose to derive from @Widget@ instead of @StatefulWidget@!) - it is run every time the widget is instantiated.
  
= code "app/cells/twitter_widget.rb", :tag => "v10", :lines => 1..16

:textile
  Instead of adding the kids in an explicit state (that was in @#display_form@ before) we put the setup on the class layer (line 8-12).
  
  Clicking the heart now works... nothing happens, though, cause we didn't setup an event handler.
  
  h2. Catching the heart beat
  
  The click should be processed in the @TweetWidget@ which fired it as well.
  
= code "app/cells/tweet_widget.rb", :tag => "v10"



:textile
  #{img "hearting-apotomo.png", :class => :right}
  
  We already know that shit. First create an observer (line 1). In @#toggle@ we, well, toggle the _loved_ state of the desired tweet and replace the content with a re-rendered @display@ view (line 9-14).
  
  And voil&agrave; - clicking the heart icon updates the tweet.
